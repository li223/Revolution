# Revolution
C# API Wrapper for Revolt - https://revolt.chat

Some core features are still pending but your most basic stuff such as sending messages and modifying channels have been implemented.

# Why
Revolt seems like fun, the api is fun, and much like my soul; my will to program is dead.

Maybe this will take off as a proper lib some day. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
